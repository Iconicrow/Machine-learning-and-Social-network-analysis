## About
Using Graphs as the baseline to explain the friendship between students and analyzing how their gets effected with change in Graph attributes using Machine learning.This was done by manually collecting information from students about who their friends are, CGPA of the student and individual grade in each mark and several other features.


## Getting Started

## Features and Labels for ML Model :
- Custom Features :
- No of friends from the same section.
- No of friends of same gender in a ego graph of radius 2.
- No of friends of opposite gender in a ego graph of radius 2
- Standard Features :
- Degree of a node
- Eigen_centrality
- Betweeness
- Clustering
- Node Conductivity
- Node Locality
  
### Prerequisites
You would need a good knowledge Graphs and Social networks and some basics Node and Edge features to understand underlying logic behing the implementation and some knowledge of Machine learning and how to train those models is necessary.

### Installation
#### Follow these steps to set up and install the required dependencies:
#### Clone the repository:
- git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git](https://github.com/Iconicrow/Machine-learning-and-Social-network-analysis/blob/main/README.md)
#### Change into the project directory:
- cd your-repo
#### Install dependencies using requirements.txt:
- pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
The analysis of Social Networks helps in understanding how friendships are formed overtime and how they influnece the way we interact and involve and adapt to the people around us, one of such inference is this project which explains how a "Student's CGPA/Grades are influnenced by the friendships they make"
